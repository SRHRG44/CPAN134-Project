    <h3>What is Anime?</h3>
    <p class="indent">
        The term anime [a·nuh·mei] is a Japanese colloquialism used as an abbreviation for the term “animation.” Generally in Japan, the word anime (written アニメ) is synonymous with animation of any kind from anywhere. Internationally, however, anime is typically referred to as animation that is produced from Japan. The distinction between anime and cartoons is more cultural than it is technical and its origins date over 100 years ago.

    <h3>Histroy Of Anime</h3>
    <p class="indent">
        Anime means “animation” in Japan, so in theory, could apply to any form of animation from around the world, but in modern times has come to refer to any and all Japanese animation. When most people think of anime they think of vibrant and beautifully drawn scenes, that are both dramatic and heartfelt, sometimes with just a hint of magic.
        The history of anime in Japan can be traced back to the late 19th century. In fact, it was a French art movement called "Japonisme" that helped inspire Japanese artists and create some of the first examples of modern animation. However, it wasn't until World War II when Japan's government started promoting cartoons as a way to raise morale that the style really took off.
        <br>
        The first-ever Japanese animation in its most basic form is thought to have been created in 1906, but the legitimacy of this claim has been disputed by some. The short, animated film was called Katsudō Shashin depicts a young boy drawing the Japanese characters for Katsudō Shashin. It was made using fifty different frames, each of which was stenciled onto a strip of celluloid (a type of thermoplastic film).  There have been several claims that other films entered Japan around this time too, but none have been able to be fully verified.
         While there were several projects that made it to screen in Japan after 1906, including the French animated film Exploits de Feu Follet by Emile Cohl in 1912. It wasn’t until 1917 that the first commercial anime was officially produced and broadcasted in Japan (the one that most people agree to be the first, anyway). That anime was called Dekobō Shingachō: Meian no Shippai, but like most anime of the time the original copies did not stand the test of time - most of them were cut up and sold as individual frames or strips to collectors.

        <h3>How is Anime Made?</h3>
        <p class="indent">
            Anime is no different technically to the animation productions of Western culture. Which, if you know anything about, takes an incredible amount of time and work. Stories must be written, storyboarded, workshopped, taken into an animatic, voiced, and animated.

            This is a process that can take months and often years to finish. All of these projects are created from an entire studio of artists typically led by a director. This video covers the workflows from various animation studios and just how intensive it is to create animated work.

            Even with new technology that allows artists to create animation with digital tools, anime is still an arduous form to produce. Digital technology has pushed the envelope of what these films can look like stylistically with lighting techniques and more, but has not taken away from the labor of the artists. 

What makes all animation so incredible is the imagination of the artists that create it. The medium allows limits to be pushed in every genre imaginable and opens doors to stories that could not otherwise be told.
